##1. Understand the Publishing Process

Before you begin the steps in this checklist, you should take a moment to read and understand the overall publishing workflow and become familiar with how the process works. In particular, you or your development team will need to prepare your apps for release using a process common to all Android apps. The Publishing workflow documents provide the details on how publishing works and how to get an APK ready for release.

Once you are familiar with publishing in general, continue reading to understand the issues that you should consider when publishing apps on Google Play.

Make sure that you understand and follow the Google Play program policies that you accepted when registering. Google Play actively enforces the policies and any violations can lead to suspension of your apps or, for repeated violations, termination of your developer account.
